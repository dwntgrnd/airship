 * when the server is genuinely broken, so it can be generous. It has to be:
 * `hello` is written beside `git:health`, which spawns git against a cwd that
 * is not a repository, and two process spawns on a cold Windows runner do not
 * fit in a few hundred milliseconds. A fixed 600ms hold made every positive
 * case here a coin flip on that runner, and `admits a same-origin page` is the
