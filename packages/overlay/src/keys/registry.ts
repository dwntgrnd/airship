 * came after — nudge, undo, delete, tool switching, tooltips that show their own
 * shortcut — needs to answer those questions the same way, so they answer them
 * here.
 *
 * What a binding carries is `run`, `when` and `within`. The chord, the name and
 * everything a reader needs comes from `./catalog`, keyed by a typed `id`. That
 * split is what lets the shortcuts panel, the command palette and
 * `CONTROLS.md` all be generated from the same table the runtime uses, and what
 * makes a mistyped shortcut a compile error instead of a dead key.
 *
 * Field-local Enter/Escape handlers are deliberately *not* migrated: they belong
 * to the input they commit, and routing them through a global registry would
 * mean every text field had to re-declare itself. See the note in `catalog.ts`.

 * `data-tip` is the copy and `data-key` is the command, which is the whole

 * binding's label, so rewording a tooltip silently dropped its shortcut and
 * two commands could not share a name. Spread into `el()`.
